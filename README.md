# Piano Simulator

This project is a simple piano simulation that runs on desktop platforms. It uses [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for the graphical interface and [FluidSynth](http://www.fluidsynth.org/) for MIDI synthesis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following installed:
- Raylib
- FluidSynth
- A suitable soundfont file (e.g., a piano soundfont). This example assumes the soundfont file is named `piano.sf2` and located in a `resources` directory.

## Controls

The piano keys are mapped to your keyboard as follows:

-C4: S
-C#4/Db4: E
-D4: D
-D#4/Eb4: R
-E4: F
-F4: J
-F#4/Gb4: I
-G4: K
-G#4/Ab4: O
-A4: L
-A#4/Bb4: P
-B4: ;
